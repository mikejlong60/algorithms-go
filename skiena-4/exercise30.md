Consider the problem again of merging k sorted length-n arrays into a single sorted length-n array. Use an 
algorithm that first divides the k arrays into k/2 arrays. Then use the merge subroutine into to combine each pair,
the outcome being k/2 length-2n arrays.  Then the algorithm should repeat the previous step until there is only
one length-kn array.  Describe the big O value of this algorithm in terms of n and k.
